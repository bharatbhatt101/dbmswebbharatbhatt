    <h2>What is DBMS?</h2>
    <p style="color:crimson;">A database management system (or DBMS) is essentially nothing more than a computerized
        data-keeping system. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such a
        system for either manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself.In
        other words,The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the
        data efficiently. It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports,
        etc.<br><br><b style="color:black;">For example</b>: The college Database organizes the data about the admin,
        staff, students and faculty etc.

        Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information.

    <h2>What is SQL? Define DDL,DML and DCL.</h2>
    <p style="color:green;"><b style="color:darkblue;"><u>SQL</u>:</b>
        SQL stands for Structured Query Language
        SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
        SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International
        Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987
        SQL can execute queries against a database.
        SQL can retrieve data from a database
        SQL can insert records in a database.
        SQL can update records in a database.
        SQL can delete records from a database.
        SQL can create new databases.
        SQL can create new tables in a database.
        SQL can create stored procedures in a database.
        SQL can create views in a database.
        SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views.
        <br><br>
        <b style="color:darkblue"><u>DDL</u>:</b>A data definition language (DDL) is a computer language used to create
        and modify the structure of
        database objects in a database. These database objects include views, schemas, tables, indexes, etc.
        This term is also known as data description language in some contexts, as it describes the fields and records in
        a database table.
        <br><br>
        <b style="color:darkblue;"><u>DML:</u></b>A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of computer languages
        including commands permitting
        users to manipulate data in a database. This manipulation involves inserting data into database tables,
        retrieving existing data, deleting data from existing tables and modifying existing data. DML is mostly
        incorporated in SQL databases. <br><br>
        <b style="color:darkslateblue;"><u>DCL</u>:</b>Data control language (DCL) is used to access the stored data. It
        is mainly used for revoke and to
        grant the user the required access to a database. In the database, this language does not have the feature of
        rollback.<br><br>

        It is a part of the structured query language (SQL).<br>

        It helps in controlling access to information stored in a database. It complements the data manipulation
        language (DML) and the data definition language (DDL).<br>

        It is the simplest among three commands.<br>

        It provides the administrators, to remove and set database permissions to desired users as needed.<br>

        These commands are employed to grant, remove and deny permissions to users for retrieving and manipulating a
        database.<br>
    </p><br>

    <h2>What is Views?</h2>
    <p style="color:blue;">A view is a virtual table whose contents are defined by a query. Like a table, a view
        consists of a set of named columns and rows of data. Unless indexed, a view does not exist as a stored set of
        data values in a database. The rows and columns of data come from tables referenced in the query defining the
        view and are produced dynamically when the view is referenced.<br><br>

        A view acts as a filter on the underlying tables referenced in the view. The query that defines the view can be
        from one or more tables or from other views in the current or other databases. Distributed queries can also be
        used to define views that use data from multiple heterogeneous sources. This is useful, for example, if you want
        to combine similarly structured data from different servers, each of which stores data for a different region of
        your organization.<br>

        Views are generally used to focus, simplify, and customize the perception each user has of the database. Views
        can be used as security mechanisms by letting users access data through the view, without granting the users
        permissions to directly access the underlying base tables of the view. Views can be used to provide a backward
        compatible interface to emulate a table that used to exist but whose schema has changed. Views can also be used
        when you copy data to and from SQL Server to improve performance and to partition data.
    </p><br>

    <h2>What is Functions?</h2>
    <p style="color:purple;">Functions in SQL Server are the database objects that contains a set of SQL statements to
        perform a specific task. A function accepts input parameters, perform actions, and then return the result. We
        should note that functions always return either a single value or a table. The main purpose of functions is to
        replicate the common task easily. We can build functions one time and can use them in multiple locations based
        on our needs. SQL Server does not allow to use of the functions for inserting, deleting, or updating records in
        the database tables.<br><br>

        <b style="color:red;">The following are the rules for creating SQL Server functions</b>:<br><br>

        1.A function must have a name, and the name cannot begin with a special character such as @, $, #, or other
        similar characters.<br><br>
        2.SELECT statements are the only ones that operate with functions.<br><br>
        3.We can use a function anywhere such as AVG, COUNT, SUM, MIN, DATE, and other functions with the SELECT query
        in SQL.<br><br>
        4.Whenever a function is called, it compiles.<br><br>
        5.Functions must return a value or result.<br><br>
        6.Functions use only input parameters.<br><br>
        7.We cannot use TRY and CATCH statements in functions.

    <h2>What is PLSQL?</h2>
    <p style="color:slateblue;">PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of
        SQL with procedural statements.All the statements of a block are passed to oracle engine all at once which
        increases processing speed and decreases the traffic.<br><br>
        <b style="color:green;"><u>Basics of PL/SQL</u></b><br><br>

        -PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL).<br>
        - PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.<br>
        - Oracle uses a PL/SQL engine to processes the PL/SQL statements.<br>
        - PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. It allows declaration of constants and
        variables, procedures and functions, types and variable of those types and triggers.<br><br>

        <b style="color:green;"><u>Disadvantages of SQL</u></b>:<br><br>

        - SQL doesn’t provide the programmers with a technique of condition checking, looping and branching.<br>
        -SQL statements are passed to Oracle engine one at a time which increases traffic and decreases speed.<br>
        - SQL has no facility of error checking during manipulation of data.<br><br>

        <b style="color:green;"><u>Features of PL/SQL</u></b>:<br><br>

        -PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision making, iteration and
        many more features of procedural programming languages.<br>
        -PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command.<br>
        -One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types, which are stored in
        the database for reuse by applications.<br>
        -PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as exception handling
        block.<br>
        -Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where Oracle is
        operational.<br>
        -PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking.<br>
